Each file contains the train/test/validate catchment gauge IDs used in our paper.

In our paper we use all but one of the 671 CAMELS watersheds. These were shuffled randomly and split into 470 training, 100 test, and 100 validation catchments.

We removed Gauge number 03281100 for which no signatures were available.

newman-2017.txt contains the list of 531 catchments that Newman et al. (2017) used in their study "Benchmarking of a physically based hydrologic model". This is for comparison with their work.
